## Summary

This code introduces Python basics, including:

- **Variables & Data Types:** Demonstrates strings, integers, floats, and booleans.
- **Basic Operations:** Shows arithmetic operations and type conversions.
- **Printing:** Uses `print()` with concatenation and f-strings.
- **Type Checking:** Uses `type()` to check variable types.
- **Comments:** Explains single-line and multi-line comments.
- **Variable Naming:** Shows valid and invalid variable names.
- **Constants:** Uses uppercase for constants (e.g., `PI`).
- **Boolean Logic:** Explains implicit conversion between booleans and integers.
- **Precision:** Covers floating-point precision, rounding, and using the `decimal` module for higher precision.

This serves as a foundation for understanding Python's core concepts.
